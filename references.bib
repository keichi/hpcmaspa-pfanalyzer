abstract = {A new set of benchmarks has been developed for the performance evaluation of highly parallel supercomputers. These benchmarks consist of five parallel kernels and three simulated application benchmarks. Together they mimic the computation and data movement characteristics of large scale Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) applications. The principal distinguishing feature of these benchmarks is their 'pencil and paper' specification-all details of these benchmarks are specified only algorithmically. In this way many of the difficulties associated with conventional benchmarking approaches on highly parallel systems are avoided.},

abstract = {Cytoscape is an open source software project for integrating biomolecular interaction networks with high-throughput expression data and other molecular states into a unified conceptual framework. Although applicable to any system of molecular components and interactions, Cytoscape is most powerful when used in conjunction with large databases of protein-protein, protein-DNA, and genetic interactions that are increasingly available for humans and model organisms. Cytoscape's software Core provides basic functionality to layout and query the network; to visually integrate the network with expression profiles, phenotypes, and other molecular states; and to link the network to databases of functional annotations. The Core is extensible through a straightforward plug-in architecture, allowing rapid development of additional computational analyses and features. Several case studies of Cytoscape plug-ins are surveyed, including a search for interaction pathways correlating with changes in gene expression, a study of protein complexes involved in cellular recovery to DNA damage, inference of a combined physical/functional interaction network for Halobacterium, and an interface to detailed stochastic/kinetic gene regulatory models.},

abstract = {The fat tree topology with multipath capability has been used in many recent data center networks (DCNs) for increased bandwidth and fault tolerance. Traditional routing protocols have only limited support for multipath routing, and cannot fully utilize the available bandwidth in such networks. In this paper, we study multipath routing for fat tree networks. We formulate the problem as a linear program and prove its NP-completeness. We propose a practical solution, which takes advantage of the emerging software-defined networking paradigm. Our algorithm relies on a central controller to collect necessary network state information in order to make optimized routing decisions. We implemented the algorithm as an OpenFlow controller module and validated it with Mininet emulation. We also developed a fluid-based DCN simulator and conducted experiments, which show that our algorithm outperforms the traditional multipath algorithm based on random assignments, both in terms of increased throughput and in reduced end-to-end delay.},

abstract = {The steadily increasing number of nodes in high-performance computing systems and the technology and power constraints lead to sparse network topologies. Efficient mapping of ap- plication communication patterns to the network topology gains importance as systems grow to petascale and beyond. Such mapping is supported in parallel programming frame- works such as MPI, but is often not well implemented. We show that the topology mapping problem is NP-complete and analyze and compare different practical topology map- ping heuristics. We demonstrate an efficient and fast new heuristic which is based on graph similarity and show its util- ity with application communication patterns on real topolo- gies. Our mapping strategies support heterogeneous net- works and show significant reduction of congestion on torus, fat-tree, and the PERCS network topologies, for irregular communication patterns. We also demonstrate that the ben- efit of topology mapping grows with the network size and show how our algorithms can be used in a practical setting to optimize communication performance. Our efficient topol- ogy mapping strategies are shown to reduce network con- gestion by up to 80{\%}, reduce average dilation by up to 50{\%}, and improve benchmarked communication performance by 18{\%}.},

abstract = {As the size of today{\&}{\#}x02019;s supercomputers grow exponentially in numbers of processors, the applications that run on these systems scale to larger processor counts. The majority of these applications commonly use Message Passing Interface (MPI); a trace of these MPI communication events is an important input to the tools that visualize, simulate for performance modeling, or enable tuning of parallel applications. We introduce an efficient, accurate and flexible trace-driven performance modeling and prediction tool, PMaC{\&}{\#}x02019;s Open Source Interconnect and Network Simulator (PSINS), for MPI applications. A principal feature of PSINS is its usability for applications that scale up to large processor counts. PSINS generates compact and tractable event traces for fast and efficient simulations while producing accurate performance predictions. PSINS was incorporated into PMaC{\&}{\#}x02019;s automated performance prediction framework and used to model three applications from the High Performance Computing Modernization Program{\&}{\#}x02019;s (HPCMP) Technology Insertion 2009 (TI-09) application suite.},

While the PMPI-interface allows timing MPI-functions through wrappers, it can not provide MPI-internal information on MPI-states and lower-level network performance. We introduce the general design criteria of the interface implementation and analyze the overhead generated by this functionality. To support performance evaluation of large-scale applications, tools for visualization are imperative. We extend the tracing library of the Paraver-toolkit to support tracing Peruse-events and show how this helps detecting performance bottlenecks.
