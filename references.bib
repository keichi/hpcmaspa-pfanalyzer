abstract = {The fat tree topology with multipath capability has been used in many recent data center networks (DCNs) for increased bandwidth and fault tolerance. Traditional routing protocols have only limited support for multipath routing, and cannot fully utilize the available bandwidth in such networks. In this paper, we study multipath routing for fat tree networks. We formulate the problem as a linear program and prove its NP-completeness. We propose a practical solution, which takes advantage of the emerging software-defined networking paradigm. Our algorithm relies on a central controller to collect necessary network state information in order to make optimized routing decisions. We implemented the algorithm as an OpenFlow controller module and validated it with Mininet emulation. We also developed a fluid-based DCN simulator and conducted experiments, which show that our algorithm outperforms the traditional multipath algorithm based on random assignments, both in terms of increased throughput and in reduced end-to-end delay.},

@article{Tikir2009,
abstract = {As the size of today{\&}{\#}x02019;s supercomputers grow exponentially in numbers of processors, the applications that run on these systems scale to larger processor counts. The majority of these applications commonly use Message Passing Interface (MPI); a trace of these MPI communication events is an important input to the tools that visualize, simulate for performance modeling, or enable tuning of parallel applications. We introduce an efficient, accurate and flexible trace-driven performance modeling and prediction tool, PMaC{\&}{\#}x02019;s Open Source Interconnect and Network Simulator (PSINS), for MPI applications. A principal feature of PSINS is its usability for applications that scale up to large processor counts. PSINS generates compact and tractable event traces for fast and efficient simulations while producing accurate performance predictions. PSINS was incorporated into PMaC{\&}{\#}x02019;s automated performance prediction framework and used to model three applications from the High Performance Computing Modernization Program{\&}{\#}x02019;s (HPCMP) Technology Insertion 2009 (TI-09) application suite.},
