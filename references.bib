abstract = {Following the first full year of Large Hadron Collider (LHC) data taking, the Worldwide LHC Computing Grid (WLCG) computing environment built to support LHC data processing and analysis has been validated. In this review, I discuss the rationale for the design of a distributed system and describe how this environment was constructed and deployed through the use of grid computing technologies. I discuss the experience with large-scale testing and operation with real accelerator data, which shows that expectations have been met and sometimes exceeded. The computing system's key achievements are that (a) the WLCG infrastructure is distributed and makes use of all the dispersed resources, (b) the experiments' computing models are also distributed and can make excellent use of the infrastructure, and (c) the computing system has enabled physics output in a very short time. Finally, I present prospects for the future evolution of the WLCG infrastructure.},

abstract = {Big-Data applications need to shuffle their data over a network in a very large amount. The ability to efficiently allocate network resources to quickly finish the shuffle greatly affects the overall processing speed of Big-Data applications. The recent emergence of software-defined networking (SDN) technology makes it easier for the network to integrate with a Big- Data application. The network can allocate network resources based on an application's run-time requirements to accelerate the speed of Big-Data delivery. In this paper, we used Hadoop as a Big-Data application platform and designed an application-aware SDN routing scheme for Hadoop to accelerate its MapReduce data shuffling over a network. Our results show that our method can outperform the ECMP-RR scheme by up to 20{\%} and outperform the Spanning Tree method and the Floodlight OpenFlow controller by up to 70{\%}.},

@article{McKeown2008,
abstract = {This whitepaper proposes OpenFlow: a way for researchers to run experimental protocols in the networks they use ev- ery day. OpenFlow is based on an Ethernet switch, with an internal flow-table, and a standardized interface to add and remove flow entries. Our goal is to encourage network- ing vendors to add OpenFlow to their switch products for deployment in college campus backbones and wiring closets. We believe that OpenFlow is a pragmatic compromise: on one hand, it allows researchers to run experiments on hetero- geneous switches in a uniform way at line-rate and with high port-density; while on the other hand, vendors do not need to expose the internal workings of their switches. In addition to allowing researchers to evaluate their ideas in real-world traffic settings, OpenFlow could serve as a useful campus component in proposed large-scale testbeds like GENI. Two buildings at Stanford University will soon run OpenFlow networks, using commercial Ethernet switches and routers. We will work to encourage deployment at other schools; and We encourage you to consider deploying OpenFlow in your university network too.},
