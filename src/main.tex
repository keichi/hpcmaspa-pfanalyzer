% Abstract
\begin{abstract}
    Recent rapid scale out of high performance computing systems has
    been continuously increasing the scale and complexity of the
    interconnects. As a result, current static and over-provisioned
    interconnects are becoming cost-ineffective. From the background, we have
    been currently working on the integration of network programmability into
    the interconnect control, based on the idea that dynamically optimizing
    the packet flow in the interconnect to fit the communication pattern of
    applications can increase the utilization of interconnects and improve
    application performance. Simulators come in handy especially when
    investigating the performance characteristics of interconnects with
    different topologies and parameters. However, little effort has been put
    for the simulation of dynamically controlled interconnects, while
    simulators for static interconnects have been extensively researched and
    developed. To facilitate the analysis on the performance characteristics
    of dynamic interconnects, we have developed a simulator specialized to
    dynamic interconnects. Our simulator allows interconnect researchers and
    designers to investigate the congestion in the interconnect for an
    arbitrary cluster configuration and a set of communication patterns
    collected by a dedicated tool. Through the use of the toolset, this paper
    shows how dynamically controlling the interconnects can reduce congestion
    and potentially improve the performance of applications.
