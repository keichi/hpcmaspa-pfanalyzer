## Abstract

Due to the rapid scale out of high-performance computing systems,
interconnects are becoming increasingly large-scale and complex. Current
static and over-provisioned interconnects are becoming cost-ineffective
because of this trend. We have been developing SDN-enhanced MPI, a framework
that optimizes the interconnect to fit the communication patterns of MPI
applications by leveraging the dynamic network controllability of
Software-Defined Networking (SDN). Our previous works have demonstrated the
acceleration of several individual MPI primitives based on the idea of
SDN-enhanced MPI. However, the effect of SDN-enhanced MPI on the utilization
of interconnects and performance of real-world applications is yet unclear. To
answer this question, we developed an MPI tracer and online analyzer to
extract the communication patterns from applications. Furthermore, we
developed an interconnect simulator to investigate the congestion in the
interconnect for a given cluster configuration and set of communication
patterns. By using these tools, we show how SDN-enhanced MPI can reduce
congestion in the interconnect and potentially improve the performance of
applications.
